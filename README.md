# Breast-Cancer-Predictor
Breast cancer is a type of tumour that stems in the tissues of the breast. It is the most common cancer in women worldwide and one of the top causes of female mortality. As a result, patients with breast cancer will benefit from early detection and diagnosis. In order to classify tumours as benign or malignant, this paper compared nine supervised machine learning techniques: Support Vector Machine (SVM), K-Nearest Neighbours (KNN), Random Forest Classifier (RFC), Decision Tree Classifier (DTC), Logistic Regression (LR), Gaussian Naive Bayes (GNB), Artificial Neural Network (ANN), XGBoost Classifier (XGB), and AdaBoost Classifier (ADB). The data set was obtained from the UCI Machine Learning repository and is used to predict breast cancer.
